# Darksky-CLI

First day learning js outside of the browser! This cute little application gets the current temperature and a brief forecast from the darksky forecast API. To run, insert your API keys for Google Maps and Darksky into `/config/apis.json`, then pass your location search(es) as command line arguments.
